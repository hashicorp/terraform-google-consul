# Consul for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This repo contains a Terraform Module for how to deploy a [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) cluster on
[GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Consul is a distributed, highly-available
tool that you can use for service discovery and key/value storage. A Consul cluster typically includes a small number
of server nodes, which are responsible for being part of the [consensus
quorum](https://www.consul.io/docs/architecture/consensus), and a larger number of client nodes, which you typically
run alongside your apps:

## How to use this Module

Each Module has the following folder structure:

- [modules](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules): This folder contains the reusable
  code for this Module, broken down into one or more submodules.
- [examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/examples): This folder contains examples
  of how to use the submodules.
- [test](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/test): Automated tests for the submodules and
  examples.

To deploy Consul servers using this Module:

1. Create a Consul Image using a Packer template that references the [install-consul module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/install-consul).
   Here is an [example Packer template](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/examples/consul-image#quick-start). Note that Google Cloud does not support custom
   public Images so you must build this Packer template on your own to proceed.

1. Deploy that Image across a Compute Instance Group using the Terraform [consul-cluster module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/consul-cluster)
   and execute the [run-consul script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/run-consul) with the `--server` flag during boot on each
   Instance in the Compute Instance Group to form the Consul cluster. Here is [an example Terraform
   configuration](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/examples/root-example#quick-start) to provision a Consul cluster.

To deploy Consul clients using this Module:

1. Use the [install-consul module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/install-consul) to install Consul alongside your application code.
1. Before booting your app, execute the [run-consul script](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/run-consul) with `--client` flag.
1. Your app can now usr the local Consul agent for service discovery and key/value storage.
1. Optionally, you can use the [install-dnsmasq module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/install-dnsmasq) to configure Consul as the DNS for a
   specific domain (e.g. `.consul`) so that URLs such as `foo.service.consul` resolve automatically to the IP
   address(es) for a service `foo` registered in Consul (all other domain names will be continue to resolve using the
   default resolver on the OS).

## What's a Terraform Module?

A Terraform Module refers to a self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that are managed as a group. This repo
is a Terraform Module and contains many "submodules" which can be composed together to create useful infrastructure patterns.

## Who created this Module?

These modules were created by [Gruntwork](http://www.gruntwork.io/?ref=repo_gcp_consul), in partnership with HashiCorp, in 2017 and maintained through 2021. They were deprecated in 2022, see the top of the README for details.


## Code included in this Terraform Module:

- [install-consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/install-consul): This module installs Consul using a [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
  template to create a Consul [Custom Image](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images).

- [consul-cluster](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/consul-cluster): The module includes Terraform code to deploy a Consul Image across a [Managed
  Compute Instance Group](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups/).

- [run-consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/run-consul): This module includes the scripts to configure and run Consul. It is used
  by the above Packer module at build-time to set configurations, and by the Terraform module at runtime
  with the Instance's [Startup Script](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript) to create the cluster.

- [install-dnsmasq module](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/tree/master/modules/install-dnsmasq): Install [Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html)
  and configure it to forward requests for a specific domain to Consul. This allows you to use Consul as a DNS server
  for URLs such as `foo.service.consul`.


## How is this Terraform Module versioned?

This Terraform Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release,
along with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-google-consul/releases).

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a
stable API. Once we hit `1.0.0`, we will make every effort to maintain a backwards compatible API and use the MAJOR,
MINOR, and PATCH versions on each release to indicate any incompatibilities.
