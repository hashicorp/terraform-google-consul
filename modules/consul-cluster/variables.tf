Unfortunately, as of August 2017, Google only supports the options 'RESTART' (instantly restart all Compute Instances and launch new ones from the new Template) or 'NONE' (do nothing; updates should be handled manually). Google does offer a rolling updates feature that perfectly meets our needs, but this is in Alpha (https://goo.gl/MC3mfc). Therefore, until this module supports a built-in rolling update strategy, we recommend using `NONE` and using the alpha rolling updates strategy to roll out new Consul versions. As an alpha feature, be sure you are comfortable with the level of risk you are taking on. For additional detail, see https://goo.gl/hGH6dd."
